## 📌 About This Tutorial

Python sets are a powerful data structure used to store **unique elements**.  
They are extremely useful when working with collections where duplicates should not exist and when performing operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

In this tutorial, we explore Python sets from the basics to practical real-world use cases, all demonstrated using **Jupyter Notebook**.
