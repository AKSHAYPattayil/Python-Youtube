## 📌 About This Tutorial

Python lists are one of the most powerful and widely used data structures in Python.  
They allow you to store, modify, and organize multiple values in a single variable.

In this video, we explore **Python lists in depth**, starting from the basics and gradually moving to more advanced operations such as slicing, membership checks, adding and removing elements, and sorting.

All concepts are demonstrated using **Jupyter Notebook**, giving you a clear and practical understanding of how lists work in real programs.
