## 📌 About This Tutorial

Tuples are an important built-in data structure in Python used to store ordered collections of values.  
Unlike lists, tuples are **immutable**, which makes them useful in situations where data should not be changed.

In this tutorial, we explore Python tuples from the basics to advanced concepts, using **Jupyter Notebook** for hands-on demonstrations.

This lesson gives you a strong foundation to work confidently with tuples in real-world Python programs.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- What Python tuples are and how they work
- Different ways to declare a tuple
- Nested tuples
- Indexing and slicing
- Tuple concatenation
- Using `min()`, `max()`, and `sum()` with tuples
- The immutability nature of tuples
- Sorting a tuple
- Packing and unpacking
- Using the `help()` function to explore tuple methods

## 📓 Jupyter Notebook

All demonstrations in this video are done using **Jupyter Notebook**, allowing you to:
- Run tuple operations interactively
- Experiment with examples
- Understand tuple behavior clearly

## 🚀 Why Tuples Matter

Tuples are widely used when:
- Data should not change
- Returning multiple values from functions
- Storing fixed collections

Understanding tuples helps you write **safer and more efficient Python code**.
