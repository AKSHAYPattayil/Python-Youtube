## 📌 About This Tutorial

When working with objects, lists, and other data structures in Python, copying data the wrong way can lead to **unexpected bugs** and **confusing behavior**.

In this video, we clearly explain the difference between **Shallow Copy** and **Deep Copy**, showing how each one works and when you should use them.  
All demonstrations are done using **Jupyter Notebook**, making the concepts easy to visualize and understand.

This topic is essential for anyone working with:
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Nested data structures
- Objects in Python
